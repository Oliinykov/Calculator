Simple calculator program in JavaScript that takes input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations.
This program creates an HTML form with two input fields for the numbers to be calculated, a dropdown menu to select the operator, a "Calculate" button to perform the calculation, and an output field to display the result.

The calculate() function is called when the "Calculate" button is clicked. It gets the values of the two input fields and the selected operator, performs the calculation based on the selected operator, and then displays the result in the output field.

Note that this program only performs integer arithmetic. To handle floating-point numbers, you can use the parseFloat() function instead of parseInt(). Also, this program doesn't handle errors or input validation, so you should add appropriate error handling and validation as needed.
